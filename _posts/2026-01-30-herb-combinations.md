Basil and parsley grow well together because they have similar water and sunlight needs. Basil helps repel insects, while parsley grows steadily alongside it. This combination is perfect for kitchen gardens.

## Basil and Oregano
Both herbs love full sunlight and well-drained soil. Oregano acts as a natural pest repellent, protecting basil. They are commonly used together in cooking, making them a practical pair.

## Mint and Lemon Balm
Mint and lemon balm belong to the same family and grow aggressively. Plant them together in a container to control spreading. Both herbs prefer partial sunlight and moist soil.

## Rosemary and Thyme
These Mediterranean herbs love dry soil and full sun. They require very little water and grow well together in pots. This combination is ideal for beginners who tend to overwater plants.

## Sage and Rosemary
Sage and rosemary thrive in similar conditions and need good air circulation. Both are drought-tolerant and long-lasting, making them a low-maintenance combination.

## Coriander and Dill
Coriander and dill grow quickly and prefer cooler temperatures. They can be grown together during early seasons. Let some plants flower to attract beneficial insects.

## Chives and Parsley
Chives help repel pests and protect parsley from insects. Both grow well in containers and require moderate watering and sunlight.

## Lemongrass and Mint
Lemongrass grows tall while mint spreads horizontally, making them compatible. This combination works well in large pots or garden beds and helps repel mosquitoes.

## Tulsi (Holy Basil) and Mint
Tulsi and mint grow well in warm climates and need regular watering. Tulsi provides shade for mint during hot days, improving growth.

## Fennel and Dill (Separate Container)
Although fennel should not be planted with most herbs, it grows well with dill if kept in a separate container. This avoids growth inhibition while allowing easy care.
## Why Growing Herbs in Combination Works

Herb combinations work because many herbs have similar needs for sunlight, water, and soil. When planted together correctly, herbs can protect each other from pests, improve growth, and make better use of space. This method is also known as companion planting and is especially useful for beginners.
