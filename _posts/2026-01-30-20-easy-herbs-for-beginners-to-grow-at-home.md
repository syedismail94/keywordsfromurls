## Basil
Basil grows best in warm weather and needs regular harvesting to stay bushy. Pinching off flower buds helps the plant produce more leaves. Avoid cold temperatures, as basil dies quickly in frost.

## Mint
Mint prefers consistently moist soil and grows aggressively through runners. Always grow it in a container to prevent it from taking over your garden. Harvest often to keep leaves tender

## Coriander (Cilantro)
Coriander bolts quickly in hot weather, so grow it in cooler seasons or partial shade. Harvest leaves early for best flavor. For seeds (coriander spice), allow the plant to flower.

## Parsley
Parsley takes time to germinate but grows steadily once established. It can survive mild cold and grows well indoors near sunlight. Harvest outer leaves first to allow regrowth.Parsley takes time to germinate but grows steadily once established. It can survive mild cold and grows well indoors near sunlight.

## Thyme
Thyme prefers dry soil and does not like overwatering. It’s a perennial herb, meaning it comes back every year. Flavor improves when grown in full sun.

## Rosemary
Rosemary needs excellent drainage and dislikes wet soil. It can be grown as a small shrub and lasts many years. Prune lightly to maintain shape and encourage new growth.

## Chives

Chives grow in clumps and can be harvested frequently. Cut leaves from the base instead of pulling them out. Purple flowers are edible and attract pollinators.

## Oregano

Oregano becomes more flavorful when grown in dry, sunny conditions. Too much water reduces aroma. Regular trimming keeps the plant compact and productive.

## Lemongrass

Lemongrass grows tall and needs space or a deep pot. Harvest stalks from the outer edges once the plant matures. It thrives in hot and humid climates.

## Dill

Dill does not transplant well, so sow seeds directly where it will grow. It grows quickly but has a short life cycle. Let some plants flower to attract beneficial insects.

## Sage

Sage prefers dry soil and plenty of sunlight. Avoid watering too often. Older plants may become woody, so pruning helps keep growth fresh.

## Fenugreek (Methi)

Fenugreek is one of the fastest-growing herbs and can be harvested within 20–30 days. Leaves are used fresh, while seeds are used as spice. Ideal for beginners in Indian climates.

## Curry Leaves

Curry leaf plants grow slowly at first but become long-lasting trees. They need warmth and sunlight. Protect young plants from cold and overwatering.

## Bay Leaf

Bay leaf plants are slow growers and usually harvested after a year. Leaves are stronger when dried before use. They prefer moderate sunlight and patience.

## Aloe Vera

Aloe vera stores water in its leaves, so water only when soil is completely dry. It grows well indoors near windows. Overwatering is the most common mistake.

## Holy Basil (Tulsi)

Tulsi grows well in warm climates and needs daily sunlight. Regular pruning keeps it healthy. It is commonly used for tea and traditional remedies.

## Lavender

Lavender needs dry soil and good airflow. Too much moisture can cause root rot. Harvest flowers just before full bloom for best fragrance.

## Fennel

Fennel needs space because it grows tall and wide. Leaves, seeds, and bulb are all useful. Avoid planting near other herbs as it can inhibit growth.

## Chamomile

Chamomile grows best in cooler temperatures and light soil. Flowers are harvested for tea once fully open. It also improves nearby plant health.

## Stevia

Stevia leaves are sweetest before flowering. It prefers warm weather and moderate watering. Dry leaves can be powdered for natural sweetener use.
